#Simon Game
------------

Final project for C programming course

This program implements the [Simon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) in C. You need to connect it to a DAQ(Data Acquisition Module) or DAQ simulator to make it work.

The difficulty level of the game can be changed easily by changing the value of the max length of the sequence generated in the game.
