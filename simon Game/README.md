#Simon Game


Final project for C programming course

This program implements the [Simon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) in C. You need to connect it to a **DAQ** (*Data Acquisition Module*) or DAQ simulator to make it work.

  * Set DAQ simulator into four buttons display mode. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. It starts from a sequence of three.

  * The **difficulty level** of the game can be changed by changing max number of buttons to be lighted up as the game progresses.
